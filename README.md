# Hi there!

I'm a 16yo girl who likes to code and learn new things.<br/>
I started coding when I was 14yo with a [Discord bot](https://beta.fembot.online) still unfinished lol

## This is my website repository

I'm using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to build it.<br/>
I'm also using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy it.
